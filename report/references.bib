  abstract    = "The ability to easily and efficiently analyse RNA-sequencing
                 data is a key strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting
                 with counts summarised at the gene-level, a typical analysis
                 involves pre-processing, exploratory data analysis,
                 differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the
                 results obtained informing future experiments and validation
                 studies. In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing
                 data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the
                 popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and
                 normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its
                 voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation
                 to assess differential expression and perform gene set
                 testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma
                 package which enables interactive exploration of the results
                 so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the
                 user. The complete analysis offered by these three packages
                 highlights the ease with which researchers can turn the raw
                 counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into biological
                 insights using Bioconductor.",
